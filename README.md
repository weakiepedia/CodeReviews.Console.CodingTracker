# Coding Time Tracker
This console application lets user monitor his time spent on coding, the data is saved on local database.

### I used: 
- Dapper
- SQLite
- Spectre.Console

### Features:
- View data from database as a table
- View total and average time spent on coding
- Insert data to database (User can add either enter data manually or let the app do it automatically)
- Delete data from database
- Update data in database
